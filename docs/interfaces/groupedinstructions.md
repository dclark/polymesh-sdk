###  failed

• **failed**: *[Instruction](../classes/instruction.md)[]*

  This group supersedes the other three, so for example, a failed Instruction
  might also belong in the `affirmed` group, but it will only be included in this one

___

###  pending

• **pending**: *[Instruction](../classes/instruction.md)[]*

*Defined in [src/types/index.ts:1363](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymesh-sdk/blob/38ee8078/src/types/index.ts#L1363)*

Instructions that still need to be affirmed/rejected by the Identity
