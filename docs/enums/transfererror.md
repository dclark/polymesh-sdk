# Enumeration: TransferError

Akin to TransferStatus, these are a bit more granular and specific. Every TransferError translates to
  a [TransferStatus](transferstatus.md), but two or more TransferErrors can represent the same TransferStatus, and
  not all Transfer Statuses are represented by a TransferError
